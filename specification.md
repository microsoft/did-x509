## Abstract

The did:x509 method aims to achieve interoperability between existing X.509 solutions and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to support operational models in which a full transition to DIDs is not achievable or desired yet. It supports X.509-only verifiers as well as DID-based verifiers supporting this DID method.

## Introduction

The RWOT11 workshop outlined the need for hybrid solutions that combine X.509 certificates with DIDs: ["Analysis of hybrid wallet solutions - Implementation options for combining x509 certificates with DIDs and VCs"](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/hybrid_wallet_solutions_x509_DIDs_VCs.md).

The did:x509 method takes a simple approach that does not introduce additional infrastructure. Creating and resolving a did:x509 is a local operation. It relies on X.509 chain validation and matches elements contained in the DID to certificate properties within the chain.

The main difference to other DID methods is that did:x509 requires a certificate chain to be passed using a new [DID resolution option](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution-options) `x509chain` while resolving a DID. This certificate chain is typically embedded in the signing envelope, for example within the `x5c` header parameter of JWS/JWT documents.

## Example

`did:x509:0:sha256:WE4P5dd8DnLHSkyHaIjhp4udlkF9LqoKwCvu9gl38jk::subject:C:US:ST:California:O:My%20Organisation`

In this example, the identifier pins to a certificate authority using the SHA-256 certificate hash and uses the `subject` policy to express criteria which a leaf certificate's subject must fulfil. This identifier will match any certificate chains with matching leaf certificate subject fields and a matching intermediate or root CA certificate.

## JSON data model for X.509 certificate chains

This section defines a JSON data model for X.509 certificate chains that is the basis for evaluating whether a certificate chain matches a given did:x509 identifier. The language used for defining the JSON data model is CDDL ([RFC 8610](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8610)).

```cddl
CertificateChain = [2*Certificate]  ; leaf is first

Certificate = {
    fingerprint: {
        ; base64url-encoded hashes of the DER-encoded certificate
        sha256: base64url,     ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-256
        sha384: base64url,     ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-384
        sha512: base64url      ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-512
    },
    issuer: Name,              ; RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.4
    subject: Name,             ; RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.6
    extensions: {
        ? eku: [+OID],         ; RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.12
        ? san: [+SAN],         ; RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.6
        ? fulcio_issuer: tstr  ; http://oid-info.com/get/1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1
    }
}

; X.509 Name as an object of attributes
; Repeated attribute types are not supported
; Common attribute types have human-readable labels (see below)
; Other attribute types use dotted OIDs
; Values are converted to UTF-8
Name = {
    ; See RFC 4514, Section 3, for meaning of common attribute types
    ? CN: tstr,
    ? L: tstr,
    ? ST: tstr,
    ? O: tstr,
    ? OU: tstr,
    ? C: tstr,
    ? STREET: tstr,
    * OID => tstr
}

; base64url-encoded data, see RFC 4648, Section 5
base64url = tstr

; ASN.1 Object Identifier
; Dotted string, for example "1.2.3"
OID = tstr

; X.509 Subject Alternative Name
; Strings are converted to UTF-8
SAN = rfc822Name / DNSName / URI / DirectoryName
rfc822Name = ["email", tstr] ; Example: ["email", "bill@microsoft.com"]
DNSName = ["dns", tstr]      ; Example: ["dns", "microsoft.com"]
URI = ["uri", tstr]          ; Example: ["uri", "https://microsoft.com"]
DirectoryName = ["dn", Name] ; Example: ["dn", {CN: "Microsoft"}]
```

In the rest of this document, `chain` refers to the certificate chain mapped to the above JSON data model.

## Identifier Syntax

The did:x509 ABNF definition can be found below, which uses the syntax in [RFC 5234](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5234.html) and the corresponding definitions for `ALPHA` and `DIGIT`. The [W3C DID v1.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/) contains the definition for `idchar`.

```abnf
did-x509           = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
method-name        = "x509"
method-specific-id = version ":" ca-fingerprint-alg ":" ca-fingerprint 1*("::" policy-name ":" policy-value)
version            = 1*DIGIT
ca-fingerprint-alg = "sha256" / "sha384" / "sha512"
ca-fingerprint     = base64url
policy-name        = 1*ALPHA
policy-value       = *(1*idchar ":") 1*idchar
base64url          = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
```

In this draft, version is `0`.

`ca-fingerprint-alg` is one of `sha256`, `sha384`, or `sha512`.

`ca-fingerprint` is `chain[i].fingerprint[ca-fingerprint-alg]` with i > 0, that is, either an intermediate or root CA certificate.

`policy-name` is a policy name and `policy-value` is a policy-specific value. 

`::` is used to separate multiple policies from each other.

The following sections define the policies and their policy-specific syntax.

Validation of policies is formally defined using [Rego policies](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), though there is no expectation that implementations use Rego.

The input to the Rego engine is the JSON document `{"did": "<DID>", "chain": <CertificateChain>}`.

Core Rego policy:

```rego
import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.in

parse_did(did) := [ca_fingerprint_alg, ca_fingerprint, policies] if {
    prefix := "did:x509:0:"
    startswith(did, prefix) == true
    rest := trim_prefix(did, prefix)
    parts := split(rest, "::")
    [ca_fingerprint_alg, ca_fingerprint] := split(parts[0], ":")
    policies_raw := array.slice(parts, 1, count(parts))
    policies := [y |
        some i
        s := policies_raw[i]
        j := indexof(s, ":")
        y := [substring(s, 0, j), substring(s, j+1, -1)]
    ]
}

valid if {
    [ca_fingerprint_alg, ca_fingerprint, policies] := parse_did(input.did)
    ca := [c | some i; i != 0; c := input.chain[i]]
    ca[_].fingerprint[ca_fingerprint_alg] == ca_fingerprint
    valid_policies := [i |
        some i
        [name, value] := policies[i]
        validate_policy(name, value)
    ]
    count(valid_policies) == count(policies)
}
```

The overall Rego policy is assembled by concatenating the core Rego policy with the Rego policy fragments in the following sections, each one defining a `validate_policy` function.

### Percent-encoding

Some of the policies that are defined in subsequent sections require values to be percent-encoded. Percent-encoding is specified in [RFC 3986 Section 2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.1). All characters that are not in the allowed set defined below must be percent-encoded:

```abnf
allowed = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_"
```

Note that most libraries implement percent-encoding in the context of URLs and do NOT encode `~` (`%7E`).

### "subject" policy

```abnf
policy-name     = "subject"
policy-value    = key ":" value *(":" key ":" value)
key             = label / oid
value           = 1*idchar
label           = "CN" / "L" / "ST" / "O" / "OU" / "C" / "STREET"
oid             = 1*DIGIT *("." 1*DIGIT)
```

`<key>:<value>` are the subject name fields in `chain[0].subject` in any order. Field repetitions are not allowed. Values must be percent-encoded.

Example:

`did:x509:0:sha256:WE4P5dd8DnLHSkyHaIjhp4udlkF9LqoKwCvu9gl38jk::subject:C:US:ST:California:L:San%20Francisco:O:GitHub%2C%20Inc.`

Rego policy:
```rego
validate_policy(name, value) := true if {
    name == "subject"
    items := split(value, ":")
    count(items) % 2 == 0
    subject := {k: v |
        some i
        i % 2 == 0
        k := items[i]
        v := urlquery.decode(items[i+1])
    }
    count(subject) >= 1
    object.subset(input.chain[0].subject, subject) == true
}
```

### "san" policy

```abnf
policy-name     = "san"
policy-value    = san-type ":" san-value
san-type        = "email" / "dns" / "uri"
san-value       = 1*idchar
```

`san-type` is the SAN type and must be one of `email`, `dns`, or `uri`. Note that `dn` is not supported.

`san-value` is the SAN value, percent-encoded.

The pair [`<san_type>`, `<san_value>`] is one of the items in `chain[0].extensions.san`.

Example: 

`did:x509:0:sha256:WE4P5dd8DnLHSkyHaIjhp4udlkF9LqoKwCvu9gl38jk::san:email:bob%40example.com`

Rego policy:
```rego
validate_policy(name, value) := true if {
    name == "san"
    [san_type, san_value_encoded] := split(value, ":")
    san_value := urlquery.decode(san_value_encoded)
    [san_type, san_value] == input.chain[0].extensions.san[_]
}
```

### "eku" policy

```abnf
policy-name  = "eku"
policy-value = eku
eku          = oid
oid          = 1*DIGIT *("." 1*DIGIT)
```

`eku` is one of the OIDs within `chain[0].extensions.eku`.

Example:

`did:x509:0:sha256:WE4P5dd8DnLHSkyHaIjhp4udlkF9LqoKwCvu9gl38jk::eku:1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.13`

Rego policy:
```rego
validate_policy(name, value) := true if {
    name == "eku"
    value == input.chain[0].extensions.eku[_]
}
```

### "fulcio-issuer" policy

```abnf
policy-name   = "fulcio-issuer"
policy-value  = fulcio-issuer
fulcio-issuer = 1*idchar
```

`fulcio-issuer` is `chain[0].extensions.fulcio_issuer` without leading `https://`, percent-encoded. 

Example:

`did:x509:0:sha256:WE4P5dd8DnLHSkyHaIjhp4udlkF9LqoKwCvu9gl38jk::fulcio-issuer:accounts.google.com::san:email:bob%40example.com`

Example 2:

`did:x509:0:sha256:WE4P5dd8DnLHSkyHaIjhp4udlkF9LqoKwCvu9gl38jk::fulcio-issuer:token.actions.githubusercontent.com::san:uri:https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Focto-org%2Focto-automation%2F.github%2Fworkflows%2Foidc.yml%40refs%2Fheads%2Fmain`

Rego policy:
```rego
validate_policy(name, value) := true if {
    name == "fulcio-issuer"
    suffix := urlquery.decode(value)
    concat("", ["https://", suffix]) == input.chain[0].extensions.fulcio_issuer
}
```

## DID resolution options

This DID method introduces a new DID resolution option called `x509chain`:

Name: `x509chain`

Value type: string

The value is constructed as follows:

1. Encode each certificate `C` that is part of the chain as the string `b64url(DER(C))`.

2. Concatenate the resulting strings in order, separated by comma `","`.

## Operations

### Create

Creating a did:x509 identifier is a local operation. The DID must be constructed according to the syntax rules in the previous sections. No other actions are required.

When constructing a did:x509, the first step is to determine what constitutes a logical identity within a given certificate authority. Concretely, which certificate fields does an authority use to uniquely represent an identity. After that, one or more matching policies must be chosen that allow to express such an identity as faithfully as possible.

As an example, a certificate authority may exclusively use email addresses as a way to separate identities, and it may use the SAN extension to store the email address. In that case, the did:x509 identifier should be constructed using the `san` policy, for example, `did:x509:0:sha256:<ca-fingerprint>::san:email:bob%40example.com`. The certificate may contain other information about the identity, like full name and address, but the primary field that uniquely identifies the identity in this case is just the email address.

In other cases, an authority may not include email addresses at all and instead rely on a specific set of subject fields to separate identities. In that case, the `subject` policy should be used.

In yet other cases, authorities may assign unique numbers or other types of stable identifiers to logical identities. Typically, this is done to have a stable reference even if a person changes their name or email address.

In all cases, the goal is to craft a did:x509 that is both stable yet not too loose in its policies. An example of a loose did:x509 may be to use the `subject` policy and only include the `O` field without location fields like country (`C`) or state/locality (`ST`). See also the Security and Privacy Considerations section.

Finally, whether a did:x509 should pin to an intermediate CA instead of a root CA (via the certificate fingerprint) depends on whether there is value in distinguishing between them. Pinning to an intermediate CA typically means that the lifetime of the did:x509 will be shorter, since intermediate CA certificates typically have a shorter validity period than root CA certificates.

### Read

The Read operation takes as input a DID to resolve, together with the `x509chain` DID resolution option.

The following steps must be used to generate a corresponding DID document:

1. Decode the `x509chain` resolution option value into individual certificates by splitting the string on `","` and base64url-decoding each resulting string. The result is a list of DER-encoded certificates that can be loaded in standard libraries. Fail if the list contains fewer than two certificates.

2. Check whether the list of certificates form a valid certificate chain using the [RFC 5280 certification path validation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-6) procedures with the last certificate in the chain as trust anchor. If any extension, excluding the basic constraints and key usage extensions, is marked critical but is not part of the JSON data model, fail.

3. If required by the application, check whether any certificate in the chain is revoked (using CRL, OCSP, or other mechanisms).

4. Apply any further application-specific checks, for example disallowing insecure certificate signature algorithms.

5. Map the certificate chain to the JSON data model.

6. Check whether the DID is valid against the certificate chain in the JSON data model according to the Rego policy (or equivalent rules) defined in this document.

7. Extract the public key of the first certificate in the chain.

8. Convert the public key to a JSON Web Key.

9. Create the following partial DID document:

```json
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "id": "<DID>",
    "verificationMethod": [{
        "id": "<DID>#0",
        "type": "JsonWebKey2020",
        "controller": "<DID>",
        "publicKeyJwk": {
            // JSON Web Key
        }
    }]
}
```

10. If the first certificate in the chain has the key usage bit position for `digitalSignature` set or is missing the key usage extension, add the following to the DID document:

```json
{
    "assertionMethod": ["<DID>#0"]
}
```

11. If the first certificate in the chain has the key usage bit position for `keyAgreement` set or is missing the key usage extension, add the following to the DID document:

```json
{
    "keyAgreement": ["<DID>#0"]
}
```

12. If the first certificate in the chain includes the key usage extension but has neither `digitalSignature` nor `keyAgreement` set as key usage bits, fail.

13. Return the complete DID document.

### Update

This DID Method does not support updating the DID Document, assuming a fixed certificate chain.
However, the public key included in the DID Document varies depending on the certificate chain that was used as input to the DID resolution process. Typically, multiple chains, in particular leaf certificates, are valid for a given did:x509.

### Deactivate

This DID Method does not support deactivating the DID.
However, if the certificate authority revokes all certificates for the matching DID (or they expire) and does not issue new certificates matching the same DID, then this can be considered equivalent to deactivation of the DID, though there is no technical guarantee in this case and the certificate authority can revert its decision.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Identifier ambiguity

This DID method maps characteristics of X.509 certificate chains to identifiers. It allows a single identifier to map to multiple certificate chains, giving the identifier stability across the expiry of individual chains. However, if the policies used in the identifier are chosen too loosely, the identifier may match too wide a set of certificate chains. This may have security implications as it may authorize an identity for actions it was not meant to be authorized for.

To mitigate this issue, the certificate authority should publish their expected usage of certificate fields and indicate which ones constitute a unique identity, versus any additional fields that may be of an informational nature. This will help users create an appropriate did:x509 as well as consumers of signed content to decide whether it is appropriate to trust a given did:x509.

### X.509 trust stores

Typically, a verifier trusts an X.509 certificate by applying [chain validation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-6) (RFC 5280) using a set of certificate authority (CA) certificates as trust store, together with additional application-specific policies.

This DID method does not require an X.509 trust store but rather relies on verifiers either trusting an individual DID directly or using third-party endorsements for a given DID, like [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), to establish trust.

By layering this DID method on top of X.509, verifiers are free to use traditional chain validation (for example, verifiers unaware of DID), or rely on DID as an ecosystem to establish trust.
